NOTE: This project was generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) along with [@clamytoe's](https://github.com/clamytoe) [toepack](https://github.com/clamytoe/toepack) project template.

## Initial setup

```zsh
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/clamytoe/traderbot.git
cd traderbot
```

### Anaconda setup

If you are an Anaconda user, this command will get you up to speed with the base installation.

```zsh
conda env create
conda activate traderbot
```

### Regular Python setup

If you are just using normal Python, this will get you ready, but I highly recommend that you do this in a virtual environment.
There are many ways to do this, the simplest using *venv*.

```zsh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Final setup

```zsh
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```zsh
traderbot
```

The output should be: `Successfully installed your project file: traderbot`

## Possible indicators

- Value vs P/E ratio
- Earnings beats estimates

  - Who is backing

## üõ†Ô∏è Flask Dashboard Blueprint: ‚ÄúProjected Value Navigator‚Äù

This is a blueprint that I have been working on for my retirement ROTH IRA account. I plan to build it modularly:

### üì• Input Layer

- CSV or JSON parser for your portfolio holdings
- Optional form for setting share counts, current prices, and custom CAGR assumptions

### üìà Projection Engine

- Apply per-asset CAGR calculations to estimate 5-year values
- Allow toggling between current price vs. target price mode
- Show thresholds like "Take Profit" and "Buyback Trigger"

### üìä Visualization Tabs

- Summary table showing current vs projected value, % to target, potential gains
- Timeline graphs to show how projected value compounds
- Pie charts for portfolio composition ‚Äî present vs projected

### üì§ Output Layer

- Export projected values or thresholds as JSON (ready for alerts or script triggers)
- Optional integration with TradingView price alerts or shell script execution
